        <h1>About us</h1>
        <h3> A fun charity based in Leeds that aims to send fruit into schools </h3>
        <p class="lead2">We are a fun charity based in Leeds, UK <br> Our aim is to educate young children in schools about nutrition and healthy eating </p>
        <p> According to the World Health Organisation: In 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. Of these over 650 million were obese. The key adipose, or fatty tissue, development period is between 3 and 5 years old. This can result in very young children becoming aware of their weight early on in life, which can hurt their self esteem.  </p>
        <p> We believe that it is very important to make children aware of the risks of not eating a healthy, nutritious diet early on so that they can become empowered to make good decisions about their own health and feel happy about themselves.</p>
        <p> We hope that with a fun and friendly attitude we will be able to get kids more interested in healthy eating at a younger age, before weight problems can develop in adulthood!</p>

          <p>Our Vision</p>
          <p> Here at Fruit Salad we are a group of university students dedicated to giving school children the best start at life. <br>
            We believe the best way to achieve this aim is to fill their brains with nutrients, so our food science department put together
            <br> a list of the most nutitious fruits for younger students <br> and the rest of us head into to schools and tell the children the merits of eating fruit.</p>
          <p> We would like to invite you to join in our mission and give the greatest helping hand to those who need it</p>

              <p> Raquia, Year 3 said: "I always thought fruit was boring but then I saw this AMAZING website and it made me wish I brought some fruit into school with me!" </p>
              <p> Rhea, Year 4 said: "I loved it when the Fruit Salad team came to my school and showed us that fruit could be fun by making apple pies loaded with sugar!" </p>
              <p> Ling, Year 6 said: "I used to hate fruit, and I'm still not a huge fan of it! But I know that it's important to make healthy choices." </p>
              <p> Bob, Year 5 said: "Fruit is great, and this website is even better! The only they could improve is by making a version about vegetables" </p>
              <p> Ryan, 38 years old said: "I'm a big fan of the work carried out by this group of students. They've put an exceptional amount of effort into creating this
              website which is a very valuable resource. I especially love the 'Where' page with locations of fruit picking activities which have been such a good bonding experience for me and my son."
